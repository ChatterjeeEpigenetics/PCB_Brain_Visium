This study investigates the effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) on memory and transcriptomic profiles. The adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed daily to a synthetic PCB mixture and after seven weeks of exposure, the mice were assessed in a spatial object recognition task (SOR) to evaluate long-term spatial memory. Brain sections from PCB and vehicle-exposed male mice, collected one hour after the memory test session, were processed for spatial transcriptomic analyses using the Visium platform.
